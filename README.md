# GfG 160 - 160 Days of Problem Solving

Welcome to my GitHub repository where I am documenting my journey through the **GeeksforGeeks 160 - 160 Days of Problem Solving Challenge**! 🚀 Over the course of 160 days, I am diving deep into various coding problems and algorithms, solving one problem a day to sharpen my problem-solving skills and build consistency in my coding practice. The challenge covers a broad spectrum of topics ranging from **Arrays**, **Strings**, **Searching**, **Sorting**, **Dynamic Programming**, and much more.

Each day I will focus on a new problem and work through its solution, documenting my approach and code. I invite you to follow along, whether you’re a fellow coder, a student preparing for interviews, or someone looking to improve your problem-solving skills.

## About the Challenge

The **GeeksforGeeks 160 Days of Problem Solving Challenge** is designed to help individuals become more consistent in problem-solving and strengthen their understanding of algorithms and data structures. The goal is to solve one problem every day for 160 days, tackling different areas like arrays, strings, dynamic programming, graph theory, and much more.

### Why I'm Excited:

- **Consistency**: It forces me to solve at least one problem a day, helping me build a regular coding habit.
- **Diverse Problems**: The problems range from easy to hard, ensuring a steady increase in difficulty and exposure to new concepts.
- **Improved Problem-Solving Skills**: It pushes me to think critically and write efficient solutions, which is crucial for coding interviews and real-world applications.
- **Community and Learning**: GeeksforGeeks has a vibrant community of coders, and I can learn a lot from discussions, forums, and their insightful explanations.
