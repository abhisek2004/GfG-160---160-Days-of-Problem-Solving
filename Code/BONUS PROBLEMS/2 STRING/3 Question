### Palindrome Sentence

**Problem Statement:**

Given a string `s`, determine if it is a palindrome sentence or not. A palindrome sentence is a sequence of characters that reads the same backward as forward after performing the following steps:

1. Convert all uppercase letters to lowercase.
2. Remove all non-alphanumeric characters (i.e., spaces, punctuation, etc.).

### Input:

- A string `s` containing characters (1 ≤ `s.size()` ≤ 10^6).

### Output:

- Return `true` if the processed string is a palindrome, otherwise return `false`.

### Examples:

**Example 1:**

- Input: `s = "Too hot to hoot"`
- Output: `true`
- Explanation: After processing, the string becomes `"toohottohoot"`, which is a palindrome.

**Example 2:**

- Input: `s = "Abc 012..## 10cbA"`
- Output: `true`
- Explanation: After processing, the string becomes `"abc01210cba"`, which is a palindrome.

**Example 3:**

- Input: `s = "ABC $. def01ASDF"`
- Output: `false`
- Explanation: After processing, the string becomes `"abcdef01asdf"`, which is not a palindrome.

### Constraints:

- `1 ≤ s.size() ≤ 10^6`
