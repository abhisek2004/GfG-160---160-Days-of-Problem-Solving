### Problem Statement:

You are given a positive integer `n`. You need to repeatedly add all the digits of `n` and create a new number. Perform this operation until the resultant number has only one digit in it. Return the final number obtained after performing the given operation.

### Input:

- A positive integer `n` where `1 <= n <= 10^9`.

### Output:

- A single digit number that results after performing the repeated sum of digits until only one digit remains.

### Examples:

**Example 1:**

Input:  
`n = 1234`

Output:  
`1`

Explanation:  
Step 1: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10  
Step 2: 1 + 0 = 1

**Example 2:**

Input:  
`n = 5674`

Output:  
`4`

Explanation:  
Step 1: 5 + 6 + 7 + 4 = 22  
Step 2: 2 + 2 = 4

---

**Example 3:**

Input:  
`n = 9`

Output:  
`9`

Explanation:  
Since 9 is already a single-digit number, we return 9.

### Constraints:

- `1 <= n <= 10^9`
