### Problem Statement:

You have a row of flowers, where each flower blooms on a specific day. The array `arr[]` represents the blooming schedule: `arr[i]` is the day the flower at position `i` will bloom. To create a bouquet, you need to collect `k` adjacent bloomed flowers. Each flower can only be used in one bouquet.

Your task is to find the minimum number of days required to make exactly `m` bouquets. If it is not possible to make `m` bouquets with the given arrangement, return `-1`.

### Input:

- An integer `m`, the number of bouquets you need to make.
- An integer `k`, the number of adjacent flowers needed for each bouquet.
- An array `arr[]` of integers representing the blooming days for each flower.

### Output:

- The minimum number of days required to make exactly `m` bouquets, or `-1` if it is not possible to make the bouquets.

### Examples:

**Example 1:**

```
Input: m = 3, k = 2, arr[] = [3, 4, 2, 7, 13, 8, 5]
Output: 8
Explanation: We need 3 bouquets and each bouquet should have 2 flowers. After day 8: [x, x, x, x, _, x, x], we can make the first bouquet from the first 2 flowers, the second bouquet from the next 2 flowers, and the third bouquet from the last 2 flowers.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: m = 2, k = 3, arr[] = [5, 5, 5, 5, 10, 5, 5]
Output: 10
Explanation: We need 2 bouquets, and each bouquet should have 3 flowers. After day 5: [x, x, x, x, _, x, x], we can make one bouquet from the first three flowers that bloomed, but cannot make another bouquet. After day 10: [x, x, x, x, x, x, x], now we can make two bouquets, each taking 3 adjacent flowers.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: m = 3, k = 2, arr[] = [1, 10, 3, 10, 2]
Output: -1
Explanation: We need 3 bouquets, each with 2 flowers, which means we need 6 flowers. But there are only 5 flowers, so it's impossible to get the needed bouquets, and `-1` will be returned.
```

### Constraints:

- `1 ≤ k ≤ arr.size() ≤ 10^5`
- `1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5`
- `1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^9`

### Notes:

- You need to make exactly `m` bouquets with `k` adjacent flowers each.
- Each flower blooms on a particular day as specified by `arr[]`.
- Your solution should be efficient to handle the problem constraints.
