### Problem Statement:

Given a positive integer `n`, find the square root of `n`. If `n` is not a perfect square, return the **floor value** of the square root.

The **floor value** of any number is the greatest integer which is less than or equal to that number.

### Input:

- A positive integer `n`.

### Output:

- The square root of `n`, or the floor of the square root if `n` is not a perfect square.

### Examples:

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: Since 4 is a perfect square, its square root is 2.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 11
Output: 3
Explanation: Since 11 is not a perfect square, the floor value of the square root of 11 is 3.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: n = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: The square root of 1 is 1, and it is a perfect square.
```

### Constraints:

- `1 ≤ n ≤ 3 x 10^4`
