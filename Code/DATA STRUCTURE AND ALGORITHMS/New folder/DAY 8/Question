### Problem: Minimize the Heights II

**Difficulty:** Medium  
**Accuracy:** 15.06%  
**Submissions:** 624K+  
**Points:** 4

#### Problem Statement:

Given an array `arr[]` denoting heights of `N` towers and a positive integer `K`, perform exactly one of the following operations on each tower:

- Increase the height of the tower by `K`
- Decrease the height of the tower by `K`

You need to find the minimum possible difference between the height of the shortest and tallest towers after modifying the heights of each tower. It is mandatory to either increase or decrease the height by `K` for each tower. The resultant array should not contain any negative integers.

#### Note:

- After modifying the heights, the resultant array should not contain any negative integers.

#### Examples:

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
k = 2, arr[] = {1, 5, 8, 10}

Output:
5

Explanation:
The array can be modified as {1+k, 5-k, 8-k, 10-k} = {3, 3, 6, 8}. The difference between the largest and the smallest is 8-3 = 5.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input:
k = 3, arr[] = {3, 9, 12, 16, 20}

Output:
11

Explanation:
The array can be modified as {3+k, 9+k, 12-k, 16-k, 20-k} -> {6, 12, 9, 13, 17}. The difference between the largest and the smallest is 17-6 = 11.
```

#### Constraints:

- `1 ≤ k ≤ 10^7`
- `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5`
- `1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^7`

#### Expected Time Complexity:

- O(n \* log n)

#### Expected Auxiliary Space:

- O(n)
