Minimize the maximum difference between the heights

Given the heights of n towers and a positive integer k, increase or decrease the height of all towers by k (only once). After modifications, the task is to find the minimum difference between the heights of the tallest and the shortest tower.

Examples: 

Input: arr[] = [12, 6, 4, 15, 17, 10], k = 6
Output: 8
Explanation: Update arr[] as [12 - 6, 6 + 6, 4 + 6, 15 - 6, 17 - 6, 10 - 6] = [6, 12, 10, 9, 11, 4]. Now, the minimum difference is 12 - 4 = 8.

Input: arr[] = [1, 5, 10, 15], k = 3
Output: 8
Explanation: Update arr[] as [1 + 3, 5 + 3, 10 - 3, 15 - 3] = [4, 8, 7, 12]. Now, the minimum difference is 8.

Using Sorting - O(nlogn) Time and O(1) Space
The idea is to sort the array and check the maximum height difference at each index by increasing the height of towers up to that index and decreasing the height of towers beyond that index.

For any index i, if we add k to all heights in subarray arr[0...i-1] and subtract k from all heights in subarray arr[i...n-1], then we know that smallest height = min(arr[0]+k, arr[i]-k) and tallest height = max(arr[i-1]+k, arr[n-1]-k). So, the smallest difference between tallest height and smallest height over all indices will be the result.

We can see that for any index i, the smallest height depends on arr[0] and arr[i] and the tallest height depends on arr[i - 1] and arr[n - 1], so instead of modifying the subarrays arr[0...i-1] and arr[i...n-1], we can simply modify arr[0], arr[i - 1], arr[i] and arr[n - 1] to get the smallest difference between heights.


Output
8
Time Complexity: O(nlogn), as we are sorting the array.
Auxiliary Space: O(1)
