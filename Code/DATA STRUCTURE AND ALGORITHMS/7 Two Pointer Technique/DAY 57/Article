Count Distinct Elements In Every Window of Size K

Given an array arr[] of size n and an integer k, return the count of distinct numbers in all windows of size k. 

Examples: 

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 1, 3, 4, 2, 3], k = 4
Output: [3, 4, 4, 3]
Explanation: First window is [1, 2, 1, 3], count of distinct numbers is 3.
                      Second window is [2, 1, 3, 4] count of distinct numbers is 4.
                      Third window is [1, 3, 4, 2] count of distinct numbers is 4.
                      Fourth window is [3, 4, 2, 3] count of distinct numbers is 3.

Input: arr[] = [4, 1, 1], k = 2
Output: [2, 1]
Explanation: First window is [4, 1], count of distinct numbers is 2.
                      Second window is [1, 1], count of distinct numbers is 1.
