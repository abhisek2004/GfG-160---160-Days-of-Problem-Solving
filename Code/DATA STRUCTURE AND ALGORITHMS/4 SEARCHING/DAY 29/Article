Minimum in a Sorted and Rotated Array

Given a sorted array of distinct elements arr[] of size n that is rotated at some unknown point, the task is to find the minimum element in it. 

Examples: 

Input: arr[] = [5, 6, 1, 2, 3, 4]
Output: 1
Explanation: 1 is the minimum element present in the array.

Input: arr[] = [3, 1, 2]
Output: 1
Explanation: 1 is the minimum element present in the array.

Input: arr[] = [4, 2, 3]
Output: 2
Explanation: 2 is the only minimum element in the array.
