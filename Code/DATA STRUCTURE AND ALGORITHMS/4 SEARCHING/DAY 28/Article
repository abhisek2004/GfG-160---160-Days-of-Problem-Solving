Count number of occurrences (or frequency) in a sorted array

Given a sorted array arr[] and an integer target, the task is to find the number of occurrences of target in given array.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3], target = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: 2 occurs 4 times in the given array.

Input: arr[] = [1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3], target = 4
Output: 0
Explanation: 4 is not present in the given array.

[Naive Approach] Using Linear Search - O(n) Time and O(1) Space
The idea is to traverse the array and for each element, check if it is equal to the target. If it is, increment the counter.
