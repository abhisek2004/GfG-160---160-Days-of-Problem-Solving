2 Sum - Count pairs with given sum

Given an array arr[] of n integers and a target value, the task is to find the number of pairs of integers in the array whose sum is equal to target.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = {1, 5, 7, -1, 5}, target = 6
Output: 3
Explanation: Pairs with sum 6 are (1, 5), (7, -1) & (1, 5).

Input: arr[] = {1, 1, 1, 1}, target = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: Pairs with sum 2 are (1, 1), (1, 1), (1, 1), (1, 1), (1, 1) and (1, 1).

Input: arr[] = {10, 12, 10, 15, -1}, target = 125
Output: 0

[Naive Approach] By Generating all Possible Pairs - O(n^2) time and O(1) space
The very basic approach is to generate all the possible pairs and check if any pair exists whose sum is equals to given target value, then increment the count variable.
