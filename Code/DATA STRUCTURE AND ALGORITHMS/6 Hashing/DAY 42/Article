Two Sum - Pair with given Sum

Given an array arr[] of n integers and a target value, the task is to find whether there is a pair of elements in the array whose sum is equal to target. This problem is a variation of 2Sum problem.

Examples: 

Input: arr[] = [0, -1, 2, -3, 1], target = -2
Output: true
Explanation: There is a pair (1, -3) with the sum equal to given target, 1 + (-3) = -2.

Input: arr[] = [1, -2, 1, 0, 5], target = 0
Output: false
Explanation: There is no pair with sum equals to given target.

[Naive Approach] Generating all Possible Pairs - O(n^2) time and O(1) space
The very basic approach is to generate all the possible pairs and check if any of them add up to the target value. To generate all pairs, we simply run two nested loops.
