Union of Two Arrays

Given two arrays a[] and b[], the task is to return union of both the arrays in any order.

Note: Union of two arrays is an array having all distinct elements that are present in either array.

Examples:

Input : a[] = {1, 2, 3, 2, 1}, b[] = {3, 2, 2, 3, 3, 2}
Output : {3, 2, 1}
Explanation: 3, 2 and 1 are the distinct elements present in either array.

Input : a[] = {1, 2, 3}, b[] = {4, 5, 6}
Output : {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
Explanation: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 are the elements present in either array.

The idea is to traverse both the arrays a[] and b[] and for each element, check if the element is present in the result or not. If not, then add this element to the result.
