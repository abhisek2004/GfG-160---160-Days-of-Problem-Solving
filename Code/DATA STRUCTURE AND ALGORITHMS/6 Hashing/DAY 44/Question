**Problem Statement**:  
Given two integer arrays `a[]` and `b[]`, you need to find the intersection of the two arrays. The intersection of two arrays is defined as the elements that are common to both arrays. The result should contain unique elements only, with duplicates removed, and the order of the elements does not matter. After the intersection is calculated, the driver code will sort the resulting array in increasing order before printing.

**Input**:

- Two arrays `a[]` and `b[]`, where each array contains integers.

**Output**:

- An array containing the intersection of the two arrays with no duplicate elements.

**Examples**:

1. **Input**:  
   `a[] = [1, 2, 1, 3, 1]`  
   `b[] = [3, 1, 3, 4, 1]`  
   **Output**:  
   `[1, 3]`  
   _Explanation_: 1 and 3 are the only common elements. Duplicates should be removed.

2. **Input**:  
   `a[] = [1, 1, 1]`  
   `b[] = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`  
   **Output**:  
   `[1]`  
   _Explanation_: 1 is the only common element present in both arrays.

3. **Input**:  
   `a[] = [1, 2, 3]`  
   `b[] = [4, 5, 6]`  
   **Output**:  
   `[]`  
   _Explanation_: No common elements exist between the two arrays.

**Constraints**:

- `1 ≤ a.size(), b.size() ≤ 10^5`
- `1 ≤ a[i], b[i] ≤ 10^5`
