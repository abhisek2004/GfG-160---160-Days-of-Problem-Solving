**Problem Statement**:

You are given an integer array `citations[]`, where `citations[i]` represents the number of citations the researcher received for their `i`-th paper. Your task is to find the **H-index** of the researcher.

**H-Index** is the largest value `H` such that the researcher has at least `H` papers with at least `H` citations each.

### **Examples**:

#### Input 1:

```python
citations = [3, 0, 5, 3, 0]
```

#### Output 1:

```python
3
```

#### Explanation:

There are at least 3 papers (3, 5, 3) with at least 3 citations.

#### Input 2:

```python
citations = [5, 1, 2, 4, 1]
```

#### Output 2:

```python
2
```

#### Explanation:

There are 3 papers (with citation counts of 5, 2, and 4) that have at least 2 citations. However, the H-index cannot be 3 because there aren't 3 papers with 3 or more citations.

#### Input 3:

```python
citations = [0, 0]
```

#### Output 3:

```python
0
```

### **Constraints**:

- `1 â‰¤ citations.size() â‰¤ 10^6`
- `0 â‰¤ citations[i] â‰¤ 10^6`

### **Function Signature**:

```python
def find_h_index(citations: List[int]) -> int:
    pass
```
