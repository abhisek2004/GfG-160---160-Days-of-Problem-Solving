### Problem Statement: Min Chars to Add for Palindrome

Given a string `s`, the task is to find the minimum number of characters that need to be added at the front of the string to make it a palindrome.

A **palindrome** is a string that reads the same forward and backward.

### Examples:

**Input 1:**  
`s = "abc"`

**Output 1:**  
`2`

**Explanation:**  
Add 'b' and 'c' at the front of the string to make it a palindrome: `"cbabc"`

**Input 2:**  
`s = "aacecaaaa"`

**Output 2:**  
`2`

**Explanation:**  
Add 2 'a's at the front of the string to make it a palindrome: `"aaaacecaaaa"`

### Constraints:

- `1 <= s.size() <= 10^6`
