Find first non-repeating character of given string

Given a string s of lowercase English letters, the task is to find the first non-repeating character. If there is no such character, return '$'.

Examples:

Input: s = "geeksforgeeks"
Output: 'f'
Explanation: 'f' is the first character in the string which does not repeat.

Input: s = "racecar"
Output: 'e'
Explanation: 'e' is the only character in the string which does not repeat.

Input: "aabbccc"
Output: '$'
Explanation: All the characters in the given string are repeating.

[Naive Approach] Using Two Nested Loops
The idea is to use two nested loops, the outer loop for picking an element and the inner loop for finding another occurrence of the picked character in the string. As soon as we find a character which has only one occurrence in the input string, return it. If all characters have multiple occurrences, return '$'.

Output
e
Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of input string s.
Auxiliary Space: O(MAX_CHAR), where MAX_CHAR = 26 as the input string will have only lowercase alphabets.
