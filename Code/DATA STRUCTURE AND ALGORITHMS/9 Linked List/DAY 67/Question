Here is a more detailed understanding of the **Linked List Group Reverse** problem:

### Problem Statement

Given a singly linked list and an integer `k`, you need to reverse the linked list in groups of size `k`. If the number of nodes in the last group is less than `k`, that group should also be reversed.

---

### **Key Points**

1. The linked list may contain up to 105 nodes, so the solution must be efficient.
2. The reversal needs to be done in chunks of size `k`.
3. Leftover nodes that donâ€™t form a complete group at the end of the list must also be reversed.

### **Examples**

#### Example 1

**Input:**  
`head = 1 -> 2 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8`  
`k = 4`

**Output:**  
`4 -> 2 -> 2 -> 1 -> 8 -> 7 -> 6 -> 5`

**Explanation:**

- First, reverse the first 4 nodes: `[1, 2, 2, 4]` becomes `[4, 2, 2, 1]`.
- Next, reverse the remaining 4 nodes: `[5, 6, 7, 8]` becomes `[8, 7, 6, 5]`.
- The final linked list is `4 -> 2 -> 2 -> 1 -> 8 -> 7 -> 6 -> 5`.

---

#### Example 2

**Input:**  
`head = 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5`  
`k = 3`

**Output:**  
`3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 5 -> 4`

**Explanation:**

- Reverse the first 3 nodes: `[1, 2, 3]` becomes `[3, 2, 1]`.
- Reverse the last 2 nodes `[4, 5]` (less than `k` but still reversed): `[5, 4]`.
- The final linked list is `3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 5 -> 4`.

---

### Constraints

- `1 <= size of linked list <= 105`
- `1 <= data of nodes <= 106`
- `1 <= k <= size of linked list`

---

### **Approach**

The efficient solution uses:

- Iterative or recursive reversal of linked list nodes in groups.
- Maintaining pointers to keep track of previous and next nodes during the reversal process.
